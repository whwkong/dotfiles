# git submodule
#   submodule is a link
#   It referencing a single commit, not always the HEAD.
#   pushing main repo does not push sub-module's files.
# git subtree
#   subtree is a copy.
#   Integrates another repo (incl history) into main repo.  After integration
#   there is no connection to other repo.

git submodule add (repository) (directory)  # .gitmodules file will be added

# if cloning a repo, the submodules won't be pulled automatically
git submodule init      # registers submodules to their correct paths
git submodule update    # pulls in registered submodules
